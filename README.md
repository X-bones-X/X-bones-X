- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @X-bones-X
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and I'm a total beginner. In the past I learnd a bit about html, css, php
- I'm happy to receive any kind of feedback, as long as it's constructive and not "what the fuck is this". I will always publish small code and also the further development of the respective projects.
- It won't be anything great but just code like a password generator or maths conversion tools etc just beginner stuff.
- Why do I make this GitHub page?
  Because I have learnt that if others evaluate your code and suggest changes or point out alternatives, you will automatically develop faster and better. So a big thank you to everyone who is doing this
